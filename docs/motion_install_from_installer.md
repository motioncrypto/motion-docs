Motion MasterNode Install from Masternode Installer (Recommended)
-------

### Preparation

You will need an account from Digital Ocean, you can create one from the installer.

- Make sure you have at least 1000 XMN free on your Wallet.
- Make sure you have masternodes tab enabled on your Wallet (Settings -> Advanced Settings -> Show Masternodes Tab)

**NOTES:** `PRE_ENABLED` status is NOT an issue, just restart local wallet and wait a few minutes.

'WATCHDOG_EXPIRED' is not a problem if you just installed. Give time for the network to sync, 10 + Minutes.

It will create a new droplet (VPS) for each MasterNode you plan to host.

### Part 1

- Download the Masternode Installer for your platform (Currently only 64 bits OS supported).
- Close your Motion Wallet if is open.
- Run the Installer.
- Login into your DigitalOcean account.

### Part 2

Wait 5-10 minutes while we provision your VPS, sync the wallet and make magic.

### Part 3

When the installer finish the installation, close it. Open your wallet, go to Masternodes tab, right click on your new masternode and then `start alias`.

You are done. Enjoy your new Masternode.
